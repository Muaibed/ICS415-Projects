# ICS415 - Computer Graphics Course

This repository contains all the assignments, and projects for the **Computer Graphics** course.

## Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of computer graphics, including:
- Ray tracing principles
- Rasterization techniques
- Animation
- Parametric curves and Surfaces
- Real-time ray tracing
- Basics of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)


## Assignments

1. **Assignment01:** Basic Ray Tracing 
   - Implement a ray tracer with only ambient light

2. **Assignment02:** Ray Tracing - Reflection
   - Implement a ray tracer with diffuse and specular reflections

3. **Assignment03:** Ray Tracing - Shadow
   - Implement a ray tracer with shadows and reflections


## Projects 
1. **Project01:** Ray Tracer
   - A ray tracer with lights, reflections, shadows, camera positioning transparency, refraction, and supersampling.

2. **Project02:** Shader Programming
   - A fragment shader in GLSL/HLSL that applies a filter to an image.

3. **Project03:** Rasterization
   - A Minecraft-like game engine.

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to get started:  

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muaibed/ICS415-Projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the code folder
```bash
cd ICS415-Projects/code
```

3. Make sure that the drawing_base.py and vector3.py files are in the /code folder.

4. Make sure Python 3 is installed

5. Install pillow library.
```bash
pip install Pillow
```


To run any assignment or project:
Replace ## with the number of the assignment/project.
